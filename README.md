# AlphabetGame
The Alphabet Game is a elementary education game designed to help young students develop and strengthen the connection between the alphabet and real world objects.

With the standard education system being forced to restructure due to COVID-19, elementary school students are one of the groups hit the worse: in person learning is a logistical nightmare; their parents are no longer living their normal lives; and schools are more concerned with safety precautions rather than the actual learning. All of these make it difficult for students to learn. 
One of the most vital things that a student can learn is the connection of the alphabet in the real world. This is also something that is not practiced enough, regardless of COVID. So my partner and I decided to create a game that can be played to help the student learn this valuable skill.

How to Play:
The game will begin by showing 6 objects stationed around the edge of the screen. A letter will also be
displayed in the middle. You will need to select all the objects that begin with the specified letter.
There will be either 1 or 2 correct answers. Once selected correctly, it will automatically move you on
to the next letter.

This game was created in Java utilizing Swing for a GUI. This project taught be a lot, mainly how timer work with images bound to rectangles in order to change background color/make them "flash" as well as checking for uniqueness in different ways.
Due to this projet materializing as something more than just a tiny coding project, the names of the classes are a bit odd. 

** UPDATE ** :
In the code, there is a reference to a "Lo-Fi Backgrond Music," which is not included on this repository, due to its file size. Please refer to my video as to what the game should sound like while playing or email me and I can send you a shortened file.
